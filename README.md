# GridShotBot
 A try of making a bot that can beat AimLab's gridshot gamemode

It uses HSV masks to detect the shade of blue that are the balls, assuming they are the default "dark" blue color.
It uses homemade click and move to position function for the mouse because other libraries wouldn't work.
It still doesn't work because it doesn't move exactly the amount it should so it needs to make multiple values, making it take a lot of time and so being bad.
